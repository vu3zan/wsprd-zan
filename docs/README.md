Project Name :wsprd-zan
By Sunil VU3ZAN

 
This project makes use of the rtlsdr_wsprd daemon by Guenael on 
Github to receive WSPR spots [RESPECT!] using a Raspberry Pi. It 
provides a kind of utility environment for the rtlsdr_wsprd daemon. The 
crontab service runs custom band scripts, the renaming of which 
provides a simple form of band rotation. Logs generated are backed up, 
and also analysed by Utility scripts for report generation. I am using 
a Raspberry Pi Zero W successfully.

A menu system has been implemented for the utility scripts. 
Documentation in files is extensive. An effort has been made to make 
operation intuitive and easy. However the files TODO.md and details.md 
indicate how far I still have to go ... 

Feedback is welcome.
