Project Name :wsprd-zan
By Sunil VU3ZAN

 WORK IN PROGRESS,NOT SUITABLE AT THIS STAGE FOR CLONING 
 
This project makes use of the rtlsdr_wsprd daemon by Guenael on 
Githubto receive WSPR spots [RESPECT!] using a Raspberry Pi. It 
provides a kind of utility environment for the rtlsdr_wsprd daemon. The 
crontab service runs custom band scripts, the renaming of which 
provides a simple form of band rotation. Logs generated are backed up, 
and also analysed by Utility scripts for report generation. I am using 
a Raspberry Pi Zero W successfully.

A menu system has been implemented for the utility scripts. 
Documentation in files is extensive. However the files TODO.md and 
details.md indicate how far I still have to go. Feedback is welcome.
