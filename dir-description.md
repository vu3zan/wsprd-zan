 This folder $HOME/wsprd is a  Git repo on Raspberry Pi for GitHub user vu3zan (sunil), email vu3zan@gmail.com
 It is used for running the rtlsdr_wsprd daemon by Guenael on Github.
 It contains scripts for using the daemon for various amateur radio bands,
 as well as utility scripts written by me for using the daemon and generating reports etc.
The folder SAFE is excluded from git tracking, and contains only copies of band scripts.
The folder wlogs & subfolders are exluded from git tracking, and contain the operstions log plus backups, and various reports
